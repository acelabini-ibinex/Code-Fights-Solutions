Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.

Example

For n = 1230, the output should be
isLucky(n) = true;
For n = 239017, the output should be
isLucky(n) = false.

function isLucky($n) {
    $n = str_split($n);
    $n1 = array_slice($n,0,count($n)/2);
    $n2 = array_slice($n,count($n)/2);
    return array_sum($n1) == array_sum($n2);
}
