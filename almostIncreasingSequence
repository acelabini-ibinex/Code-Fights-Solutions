/*
Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false;

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.

You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. 
Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].
*/

function almostIncreasingSequence($sequence) {
    $x = 0;
    for($i = 0; $i < count($sequence)-1; $i++) {
        if($sequence[$i] >= $sequence[$i+1]) {
            if(count($sequence) > $i+2 && $sequence[$i] >= $sequence[$i+2] && $i > 0 && $sequence[$i-1] >= $sequence[$i+1]) {
                return false;   
            }
            else
                $x++;
        }
        if($x >= 2)
            return false;
    }
    
    return true;
}
